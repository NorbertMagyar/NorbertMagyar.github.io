          <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my hour+ long train commute to my workplace (thankfully mostly only twice a week), 
            I mostly read. My favourite topics have been philosophy, biology, neuroscience, history and historical biographies. Three books on biology that I
            have read within the last year are <a href="http://selfassemblingbrain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>The Self-Assembling Brain: How Neural Networks
            Grow Smarter</i></a> by <b>Peter Robin Hiesinger</b>, 
            <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123012858-how-life-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>How Life Works: A User’s Guide to the New Biology</i></a> by <b>Philip Ball</b>, 
            and <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo45084244.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>The Demon in the Machine: How Hidden Webs of 
            Information Are Finally Solving the Mystery of Life</i></a> by <b>Paul Davies</b>. Although they present different topics of biology, these authors agree 
            on one thing: cells and cellular development is incredibly complex and we are still very far from truly understanding how life works. 
            While Paul Davies posits that a new approach and paradigm that wholly incorporates information into the physics of life is required to move forward in understanding life,
            Peter Robin Hiesinger asks how is it possible that a single fertilised egg contains enough information to recreate a whole organism, focusing specifically
            on the development of neurons and targeted synapses, which seem to require much more information than could be contained within a sinlge cell. 
            Hiesinger gives a striking example of cell-encoded information through targeted synapse develoment in the animal kingdom: 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly_migration"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monarch butterfly migration</a>.
            These butterflies return to a few square kilometers of forest in Mexico, after having migrated through multiple generations (!) to California. 
            The generation that migrates to this very specific place in Mexico 
            has never been there, and not even their grandparents have been. How is it possible, then, that they have such precise information on the whereabouts of this forest? 
            Clearly, this information about the whereabouts of this forest and 
            the path to get there, has to be present, in a very compacted way, in the fertilised egg of the Monarch butterfly. 
            <br><br>
            Inspired by these incredible facts and new ways of thinking about life and cellular development as presented in these books, 
            I wanted to see whether I could come up with a toy model of cellular growth that 
            could lead to morphological complexity from simple rules, similar to the information unfolding that goes on in biological cells. 
            Unbeknowst to me until this point, but not suprising, there is a whole field of study focusing precisely on this problem,
            as presented in these recent review articles: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physics/articles/10.3389/fphy.2022.968409/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Agent-based models in cellular systems</i></a>, and 
            <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12839770/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Cell-Based Computational Models of Organoids: A Systematic Review</i></a>. 
            <br><br>
            My aim with this model was mostly to have fun coding it and to see how far can I get with my simple approach. And of course to get some pretty pictures and animations. 
            The script, written in Python and available on my <a href="https://github.com/NorbertMagyar/CellGrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, performs a clear goal:
            starting from a single cell, which are represented as little spheres of well-defined radius, follow some simple rules defining cell division, statis, and apoptosis, in a step-wise continous evolution in 3D space.
            

           
          </p>
          <p>
            I will add the model formulation, simulation setup, and first results soon.
