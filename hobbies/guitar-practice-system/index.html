        <h2>Weekly Practice System for Guitar</h2>
        <div class="post-body">
          <p>
            My main objective was consistency, not maximum session length. I split practice into
            short blocks that fit busy weekdays: technique, rhythm drills, and repertoire.
            The structure reduced decision fatigue and made it easier to start every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each block has a concrete target. Technique focuses on one pattern at a fixed tempo,
            rhythm focuses on subdivision stability with a metronome, and repertoire focuses on
            one difficult passage instead of full-song playthroughs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I keep a simple log of date, duration, and one sentence about what improved or stalled.
            That tiny feedback loop made progress measurable and helped adjust weekly priorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system is still evolving, but the biggest outcome so far is that practice feels
            much more sustainable during high-workload weeks.
